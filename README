This project can be built by cloning the scooter-simulator repo.
Each of the services (at this time there are 5 integrated in docker-compose: charger-network-config, charger-network-discovery, charger-network-gateway, charger-network-manager, and charger-accout-manager)  must be built with maven.

First, you'll need to install Docker on your machine.

Before running the docker-compose file, a Docker Volume must be created as it is referenced in the compose file. Simply run:
>docker volume create --name=spring-cloud-config-repo

Next, the docker-compose.yml file is run:
>docker-compose up --build
To stop, navigate to the directory that contains the docker-compose.yml file and run:
>docker-compose down

- The repo at https://github.com/arotaru/config is used by the Config Server for configuration of managed services
